PKG_LONGDESC="VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) CubieBoard is an open source library (libvdpau) and API designed by NVIDIA originally for its GeForce 8 series and later GPU hardware, targeted at the X Window System on Unix operating-systems (including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris). This VDPAU API allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding process and video post-processing to the GPU video-hardware. This package contains the VDPAU wrapper and trace libraries."
