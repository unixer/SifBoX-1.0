This reverts commit 7546abfb8e1f9933b549f05898377e9444ee4cb2.

The commit [7546abfb: ALSA: hda - Increment default stream numbers for
AMD HDMI controllers] introduced a regression where the AMD HDMI
playback streams don't work properly.  As the simplest fix, this patch
reverts that commit.

The upstream code has been changed largely and already contains
another fix (by changing the stream assignment order), this revert
should be applied only to 3.14 kernel where the regression was
introduced.

Greg, there is no upstream commit id due to the reason describe in the
above.  It's a simple revert, so please take as is.

thanks,

Takashi
